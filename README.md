# !! DEPRECATED !!

This repository contains the old Snap! community website. The new website is part of the cloud repository and is built with etlua templates. We're keeping this here just for archaelogical interest.

# Snap Community Website

The community website for the [Snap! programming language/environment](https://github.com/jmoenig/Snap)

## Build System

This site is powered by a super simple home-brewed page descriptor system I named **Snippets**. Check it out at [https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets](https://github.com/bromagosa/Snippets).

To build the site, do:

```
$ Snippets/build.sh
```

You can also start a webserver with `-s`, and watch changes for a live-reload experience with `-w`:

```
$ Snippets/build.sh -w -s
```
